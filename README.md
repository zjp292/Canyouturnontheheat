# Canyouturnontheheat
This code fairly decides if the heat can be turned on.



This was created out of neccessity to fairly decide when the heat can be turned on as I like the room temperature cold and my girlfriend likes it warm.
Input three factors: whether or not snow is on your window (we live on the first floor), how cold it is and how cold it feels.
